Description: Parametric change-point detection in tree structures using penalized maximum likelihood by functional pruning optimal partitioning algorithm. Data is modeled by a quadratic cost with possible use of a robust loss, biweight and Huber (see edge parameters K and a). Other losses are also available with log-linear representation or a log-log representation.
